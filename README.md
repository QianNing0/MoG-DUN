# Accurate and Lightweight Image Super-Resolution with Model-Guided Deep Unfolding Network  [[IEEE]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9257009) [[homepage]](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/wsdong/)


This repository is Pytorch code for our proposed MoG-DUN.

The code is developed by [RCAN](https://github.com/yulunzhang/RCAN)  and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 environment (Python 3.5/3.6/3.7, PyTorch 1.0.0/1.0.1, 9.0/10.0) with 2080Ti/1080Ti GPUs.

## Requirements
- Python 3 
- skimage
- imageio
- Pytorch (Pytorch version 1.0.1 is recommended)
- tqdm 
- cv2 (pip install opencv-python)


## Test

#### Quick start

#### Test on standard SR benchmark

1. If you have cloned this repository, the pre-trained models can be found in experiment fold and test dataset Set5 can be found in data fold.

2. Then, run command:
   ```
   cd code_AG
   sh test.sh
   ```
3. Finally, PSNR values are shown on your screen, you can find the reconstruction images in `../experiment/xx/results/`.
